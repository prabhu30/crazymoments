			<h3 style="color: cyan;">Crazy Moment #1 :</h3>
			<p class="paras">I was at an eye hospital, when i experienced one of my crazy moments. Must be silly, but for the first time, if i remember exactly, i have BARGAINED with an auto-driver, upon the price he had imposed on me, to reach my home. CRAZY thing is, the price i gave him is less than the price shown on OLA (An app for transport services). That's one of my crazy moments. LOL!!!!! </p>
